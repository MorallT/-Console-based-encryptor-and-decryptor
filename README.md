Project Description: Console-based Password Encryptor and Decryptor This project is a simple console-based application written in C++ that provides encryption and decryption of passwords using a basic character-shifting method. The program allows users to securely store passwords in text files, retrieve them when needed, and change them through authentication. The main features include encryption, where the user inputs a password that is then encrypted using a basic shift cipher (+15 ASCII shift) and stored in a text file; decryption, where the stored encrypted password is read from the file, decrypted by reversing the shift operation (-15 ASCII shift), and displayed to the user; and password change functionality, where the user is prompted to enter their current password, and if it matches the stored password, they can set a new password which is then encrypted and stored. The process works by selecting an option from the menu: 1 for encryption, 2 for decryption, and 3 to change the password. The user provides the filename where the password will be stored, and based on the chosen option, the program either encrypts and saves, decrypts and displays, or updates the password. Passwords are saved in .txt files using binary mode to prevent direct readability. Proper file handling is implemented with error messages for missing or inaccessible files. The project utilizes C++ as the programming language, fstream for reading and writing encrypted passwords, a simple character shift-based encoding method (+15 ASCII shift), and getline() for console interaction. Some known issues include a mistaken reference to the .tx extension instead of .txt in decodeFromFile(), the need for a more advanced encryption method for increased security, improved error handling to manage invalid inputs and prevent crashes, and the absence of a way to prevent unauthorized file access. Despite these limitations, the project provides a simple yet effective way to store and manage encrypted passwords. While the current implementation is basic, it demonstrates fundamental encryption, file handling, and authentication concepts in C++. Future enhancements could include stronger encryption algorithms, better error handling, and a GUI for improved usability.
